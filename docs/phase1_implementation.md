- **Reasoning Layer**: Focuses on business logic extraction and enrichment
- **Graph Layer**: Stores enriched data with business intelligence

#### 2. Language Agnostic Design
- **Pattern-Based Detection**: Uses naming patterns to identify business rules across languages
- **Configurable Mappings**: Rule descriptions and priorities can be configured per domain
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new business logic patterns for different languages

#### 3. Automatic Graph Enrichment
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: Business rules are automatically detected and added to the graph
- **Rich Metadata**: Each business rule includes priority, risk level, and business impact
- **Relationship Mapping**: Automatic creation of IMPLEMENTS relationships between sections and rules

### Implementation Details

#### Business Rule Detection Algorithm
```python
def _create_business_rule_nodes(self, result: BaseParserResult, program_id: str) -> List[CodeNode]:
    """Create business rule nodes from fraud rule subsections in parser result"""
    # 1. Extract fraud rules from subsections using pattern matching
    fraud_rules = []
    seen_rules = set()
    
    for subsection in result.subsections:
        if subsection.name and 'RULE-' in subsection.name:
            # 2. Extract rule type using configurable pattern matching
            rule_type = self._extract_rule_type(subsection.name)
            
            # 3. Deduplicate rules to prevent duplicates
            if rule_type and rule_type not in seen_rules:
                seen_rules.add(rule_type)
                fraud_rules.append(subsection)
    
    # 4. Create enriched business rule nodes
    for i, rule in enumerate(fraud_rules):
        rule_id = f"RULE-{i+1:02d}"
        description = self._extract_rule_description(rule.business_logic, rule.name)
        priority, risk_level = self._determine_rule_priority_and_risk(rule.name)
        
        # 5. Create node with rich business metadata
        node = CodeNode(
            node_id=f"rule_{i + 1}",
            node_type="BusinessRule",
            name=rule_id,
            language=result.program.language,
            properties={
                "description": description,
                "priority": priority,
                "risk_level": risk_level,
                "business_impact": "CRITICAL",
                "detection_accuracy": "85-90%",
                "line_range": getattr(rule, 'line_range', [0, 0]),
                "confidence": getattr(rule, 'confidence', 0.0),
                "parent_section": getattr(rule, 'parent_section', 'UNKNOWN')
            }
        )
        nodes.append(node)
```

#### Relationship Creation
```python
def _create_business_rule_relationships(self, result: BaseParserResult, program_id: str) -> List[CodeRelationship]:
    """Create relationships between sections and business rules"""
    # 1. Find the implementing section
    fraud_rules_section_id = self._find_implementing_section(result)
    
    # 2. Create IMPLEMENTS relationships
    for i, rule in enumerate(fraud_rules):
        rule_id = f"rule_{i + 1}"
        
        rel = CodeRelationship(
            source_id=fraud_rules_section_id,
            target_id=rule_id,
            relationship_type="IMPLEMENTS",
            properties={
                "description": f"Section implements {rule.name}",
                "confidence": 1.0,
                "rule_name": rule.name,
                "parent_section": getattr(rule, 'parent_section', 'UNKNOWN')
            }
        )
        relationships.append(rel)
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Automatic Business Rule Extraction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies business rules from naming conventions (e.g., "RULE-HIGH-AMOUNT")
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate rules from duplicate code sections
- **Rich Descriptions**: Maps rule names to meaningful business descriptions

#### 2. Intelligent Classification
- **Priority Assessment**: Automatically classifies rules as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW priority
- **Risk Level Analysis**: Determines business risk level based on rule type
- **Business Impact**: Assigns criticality levels for business operations

#### 3. Graph Enrichment
- **BusinessRule Nodes**: Creates dedicated nodes for each business rule
- **IMPLEMENTS Relationships**: Links sections to the business rules they implement
- **Rich Metadata**: Includes confidence scores, line ranges, and business context

### Language Agnostic Design

#### Pattern-Based Detection
The system uses configurable patterns to identify business rules across different languages:

```python
# COBOL Pattern: "RULE-HIGH-AMOUNT" in subsection names
# Java Pattern: Could be "@BusinessRule" annotations
# Python Pattern: Could be "def business_rule_" function names
# C# Pattern: Could be "[BusinessRule]" attributes

rule_patterns = {
    "cobol": ["RULE-"],
    "java": ["@BusinessRule", "BusinessRule"],
    "python": ["business_rule_", "def rule_"],
    "csharp": ["[BusinessRule]", "BusinessRuleAttribute"]
}
```

#### Configurable Mappings
Business rule descriptions and classifications can be configured per domain:

```python
rule_descriptions = {
    "RULE-HIGH-AMOUNT": "High Amount Transaction - Detects transactions exceeding suspicious amount threshold",
    "RULE-VELOCITY-CHECK": "Transaction Velocity Analysis - Monitors hourly and daily transaction frequency",
    "RULE-LOCATION-VARIANCE": "Geographical Location Analysis - Detects unusual location patterns",
    # ... more rules
}

priority_rules = {
    "HIGH": ["RULE-HIGH-AMOUNT", "RULE-VELOCITY-CHECK", "RULE-CARD-NOT-PRESENT"],
    "MEDIUM": ["RULE-LOCATION-VARIANCE", "RULE-MERCHANT-RISK", "RULE-TIME-PATTERN"],
    "LOW": ["RULE-SUSPICIOUS-CATEGORY"]
}
```

### Results and Impact

#### Enhanced Graph Intelligence
- **Business Context**: Each business rule includes rich business context and metadata
- **Relationship Mapping**: Clear understanding of which sections implement which business rules
- **Risk Assessment**: Business rules are classified by priority and risk level
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from code sections to business rules

#### Query Capabilities
```cypher
// Find all high-priority business rules
MATCH (r:BusinessRule) WHERE r.priority = "HIGH" 
RETURN r.name, r.description, r.risk_level

// Find sections that implement specific business rules
MATCH (s:Section)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(r:BusinessRule {name: "RULE-01"})
RETURN s.name, r.description

// Find all business rules for fraud detection
MATCH (r:BusinessRule) WHERE r.description CONTAINS "fraud"
RETURN r.name, r.priority, r.business_impact
```

#### Scalability and Extensibility
- **Language Support**: Easy to add new languages by defining pattern rules
- **Domain Support**: Configurable mappings for different business domains
- **Rule Types**: Extensible framework for different types of business logic

parser = COBOLParser()
result = parser.parse('file.cbl')

# Access operations
for operation in result.operations:
    print(f"Operation: {operation.name}")
    print(f"  Type: {operation.operation_type}")
    print(f"  Parameters: {operation.parameters}")
    print(f"  Complexity: {operation.complexity_score}")
    print(f"  Risk: {operation.risk_level}")
```

#### Neo4j Flow Queries
```cypher
// Find operation flow chains
MATCH (o1:Operation)-[r:NEXT]->(o2:Operation) 
RETURN o1.name, r.relationship_type, o2.name

// Find operation dependencies
MATCH (o1:Operation)-[r:DEPENDS_ON]->(o2:Operation) 
RETURN o1.name, o2.name, r.confidence
